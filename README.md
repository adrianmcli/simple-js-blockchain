# Simple JS Blockchain

This is based on a [blog post](https://kndrck.co/building-a-minimal-blockchain-in-haskell.html) written by my good friend [Kendrick Tan](https://github.com/kendricktan).

The original post used Haskell (which I am a fan of), but I am nevertheless most comfortable with Javascript. A lot of blog posts about tiny blockchains in Javascript used ES2015 classes and I wanted to see if we could simply use Flow types instead.
